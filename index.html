However, it also states: "An errant pass or head ball by the defense into their own goal is NOT credited to the opposing team." This unfortunately means that Mr. Fisch is correct in claiming that the goal scored on the 29th of August to give Arapahoe the lead against Ralston Valley should not be included in Chris Grauberger's stats.</p>
